  did you know that in 2010 a bronze gun was found! <br>
"An old swivel gun found on a remote Northern Territory beach in 2010 had been lying on the seabed for as long as 250 years, new dating tests show.
Scientists say this suggests that there was previously unknown foreign contact with Australian shores before Captain Cook landed in Australia in 1770.
A Darwin boy discovered the bronze cannon at Dundee Beach, south-west of Darwin, in 2010.
Christopher Doukas found the 107cm-long gun, an anti-personnel light artillery piece, buried in the sand during an unusually low tide.
Australian scientist Tim Stone says the find will help rewrite the nation's history." - the gardian.
